Hello, this is Shad ðŸ§”

I have worked 10 years in software development. In my 9-5 I now work within product ownership and solutions architecture, as a hobbyist I like to work on mini web projects.

Currently working a Nordic Flag Generator for my fellow vexillology fans. And also a fun little mini side-project creating a fastfood ordering app with @amirahparman.

My resume is [here](https://shadahm.github.io).
